      <p class="text-xl text-brand-gray-600 mb-16">
        Hey, I'm Jacob. This is where I share what I'm learning about business.

          <p class="mb-4">
            I'm an <strong>Information Systems Engineer</strong> by training. Graduated, worked in tech, but always felt pulled toward building businesses rather than working in them.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Today I run <a href="https://seo.resultmarketing.asia" class="text-brand-blue hover:underline">Result Marketing</a>, an SEO agency helping Malaysian businesses get found online. I also help clients automate their workflows — from CRM systems to AI-powered content.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this site isn't about my agency. It's about the learning that happens along the way.

        <!-- Why this site -->
        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-brand-black mb-4">Why I write</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            I consume a lot of business content. Jay Abraham, Alex Hormozi, Sam Parr, Dharmesh Shah — people who've built real businesses and share how they did it.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Most of their advice targets the US market. Different economy, different culture, different challenges. I take what resonates and think about how it applies to Malaysian SMEs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing helps me process and remember. If it helps you too, that's a bonus.

        <!-- Philosophy -->

            <li>
              <strong class="text-brand-black">Evidence over trends.</strong>
              <span class="text-brand-gray-600"> I value knowledge that's stood the test of time. Data beats opinions. Peer-reviewed studies beat viral threads.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-brand-black">First principles.</strong>
              <span class="text-brand-gray-600"> I try to understand WHY something works, not just copy what others do. If you understand the principle, you can adapt to any situation.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong class="text-brand-black">Hypothesis → Test → Result → Iterate.</strong>
              <span class="text-brand-gray-600"> The scientific method applied to business. Most "strategy" is really just experiments that haven't been tested yet.</span>
