excerpt: "Ryan Deiss shares his framework for going from 80 hours/week to 1 hour/week — and why most entrepreneurs choose to stay trapped."
malaysiaInsight: |
  Malaysian SME owners often wear every hat — sales, operations, finance, HR. It's exhausting, and it's why so many businesses plateau at RM1-2M revenue.

  Ryan Deiss's quote hits home: "The more valuable you are, the less valuable the company is."
  
  The Malaysian translation:
  
  1. **"Boss kena buat semua"** — If everything depends on you, you don't have a business. You have a job you own.
  
  2. **The vacation test** — Can you take 2 weeks off without checking WhatsApp? Most Malaysian bosses fail this test. The business owns THEM.
  
  3. **Team executes without you** — This is the goal. But it requires documentation, defaults, and letting go of control.
  
  **My recommendation:** Block 2 hours every Friday to document ONE process. In 6 months, you'll have 24 SOPs. That's the foundation of a business that runs without you.

## The Wall at $7-10 Million

Sam Parr opens the conversation with a truth bomb:

> "I've been running businesses for 15 years and I've hit this wall multiple times. It's somewhere around seven, eight, nine, 10 million in revenue where suddenly your biggest problem — it's not a lack of ideas. It's an issue with you. You're the bottleneck."

Enter Ryan Deiss, who built and sold multiple companies including DigitalMarketer. His key insight:

> "The more valuable you are, the less valuable the company is."

That quote changed how Sam thought about business. And it should change how you think too.

## Player vs Owner

Ryan frames the choice clearly:

> "You're either going to be the most valuable player or you're going to own the team."

Most entrepreneurs would rather be valuable:

> "Most entrepreneurs would much rather be valuable. And they would rather do the things that enable them to get started than do the things that are going to enable them to actually achieve the things that they say they want."

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

> "Really they kind of like being important. They kind of like being valuable. And I think that's — you've got to decide what do you actually want. And the nice thing is it's your business, so you get to decide."

## The Messy Entrepreneur vs The Goal

The podcast shows a graphic of the "before and after":

**The Messy Entrepreneur:**
> "You're working 80 hours a week. You're in the weeds. If you ask 'who owns this?' the answer is 'me, me' for each area. The whole team is asking you 'hey got a minute to talk about X?' 200 times a day. You're missing soccer games. You can't sell the business because it's too dependent on you. And the business owns you rather than you owning the business."

**The Ideal Outcome:**
> "It's an hour a week for you. Team executes without you, the team optimizes without you, the team decides without you. You can take a 30-day vacation, you break revenue records while you're gone, and you're exit ready if you want to."

Sam clarifies:

> "This is for an entrepreneur who wants to exit, you know, wants to build what is sort of insultingly called a lifestyle business, but is I think the main type of business I'm interested in. I use business to have a good lifestyle."

## The Process: Establish Defaults

So how do you get there? Ryan shares the starting point:

> "The way that you begin to implement it is you have to establish defaults."

**The impulse control problem:**

Sam admits:

> "The problem is impulse control. I can say that I want something and I do truly want it — but 20 years of previous behaviors have to be broken and it's incredibly challenging to actually do that. Evolving as a person is way more challenging than a lot of people think."

This is key. You can WANT freedom, but habits of being the valuable one are hard to break.

## Why Most People Stay Trapped

The trap isn't lack of knowledge. It's ego:

> "It felt really good to be the man, to be the one creating all the value, to taking all the shots and having your name everywhere and your face everywhere and your fingerprints."

The question isn't CAN you build systems. It's: **Do you actually want to stop being important?**

For many entrepreneurs, the answer is no — even if they say otherwise.

## The 30-Day Vacation Test

Here's the real test of whether you've built a business or a job:

> "Can you take a 30-day vacation... and come back to a business that's still running?"

Better yet — can you break revenue records while you're gone?

If the answer is no, you know exactly what to work on.
