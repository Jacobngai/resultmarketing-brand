excerpt: "Alex Hormozi breaks down the 4 sticking points that keep businesses stuck at $1-3M revenue. Each one feels impossible — until you solve it."
malaysiaInsight: |
  This framework explains why so many Malaysian SME owners are exhausted. They're stuck at the $1-3M revenue range, hitting the same walls Hormozi describes.

  **How this applies to Malaysian SMEs:**
  
  1. **Problem 1 (Customer)** — Malaysian culture makes it hard to say no. We want to help everyone. But taking every "Tom, Dick, and Harry" customer destroys your operations.
  
  2. **Problem 2 (Unit Economics)** — Many Malaysian businesses underprice out of fear. "Impostor syndrome" around pricing. Hormozi's advice: "You're not an impostor — you're broke."
  
  3. **Problem 3 (Over-expansion)** — The "open more branches" trap. I see this constantly — one mediocre outlet, and they want to franchise. You're scaling problems, not solutions.
  
  4. **Problem 4 (Focus)** — Malaysian entrepreneurs love "new opportunities." Every week a new idea. But switching when things get hard means you never break through.
  
  **My recommendation:** Identify which problem you're stuck on RIGHT NOW. Solve that one first. Don't skip ahead.

## The Framework

Alex Hormozi, who built Gym Launch to $100M+ and now runs Acquisition.com, lays out exactly what's holding most businesses back:

> "Every business needs to solve each of these four problems in order to make more money and scale."

These aren't abstract concepts. They're the exact walls you'll hit at $1M, $3M, and $10M revenue. Each one feels impossible until you solve it.

## Problem 1: The Customer

The first sticking point hits around $1-3M revenue. You've been taking every customer who can pay — and that's killing you.

> "In the beginning you need to sell everyone because you have no money and they have a pulse and a credit card — and you only require one of those things."

That's fine at first. But eventually:

> "When you keep taking every single Tom, Dick and Harry who can give you a third down today and 'I'll pay you when I get paid'... you deal with all of these bad customers. You promise the world. You've got a lot of different customers that all have different needs, different promises, at different price points that you've sold — and they're still just you."

**The solution?** Learn to say no.

> "What you have to do is you have to learn how to say no to people who are not the ideal customer."

Hormozi shares a powerful insight about why this works:

> "One of the most attractive things in marketing and sales is saying 'I don't need your money' — because it makes everybody want you more."

**The math:** If 10% of your customers are ideal, and they're 5-10x more profitable — what if 100% were like that?

> "You usually make five to 10 times more money. And the cool part about that process is that it doesn't require more infrastructure — you already have the infrastructure to service that number of customers. You're just servicing the wrong people because you haven't learned to say no yet."

## Problem 2: Unit Economics

You either charge too little, or pay too much.

> "You either charge too little or you pay too much. I'm a big believer in hiring great talent. I'm a big believer in bringing good people in. Absolutely. But if you want to have a frozen yogurt store and you want to pay the people behind the counter 20% of revenue each — your business will not make money."

The danger is getting this wrong then trying to "scale" your way out:

> "You have to nail the individual model where you can make enough money at full capacity."

Many entrepreneurs feel guilty charging more:

> "There's all these ethical things like 'I feel like an impostor.' Dude, you're not an impostor — you're broke. You only get impostor syndrome when you pretend to be something you're not."

Hormozi shares a specific example:

> "I had an agency owner yesterday who said 'I got to 150 clients and I have a really good client getting system, but that business stalled because I didn't know how to operate.' He said 'but I feel like an impostor charging for that system.'"

The solution? Tell the truth.

> "Why don't you just tell the truth and say 'I got 150 customers despite not knowing anything about running an agency because the system's really good. I suck at operating and so for that reason I'm just going to give you the system.'"

## Problem 3: Over-Expansion

This is the trap that catches businesses at the $3-10M range:

> "The third problem that every business has to solve is not getting over your skis — not over-expanding."

Here's what happens: Problem 2 (unit economics) isn't solved, so you try to compensate with volume:

> "Problem two often leads to problem three — you're not making up in the core business so you say 'great I'll do more of this.' But more in that instance is more of the wrong thing. A little bit isn't working, let's try a lot. You're scaling the problems, not the solution."

Hormozi sees this constantly with brick-and-mortar businesses:

> "I can't tell you the number of times I talk to local businesses who have this issue. It's mostly because we have this ego thing around growing revenue."

One mediocre location, and they want to franchise. The fix is to **perfect the unit before duplicating it.**

## Problem 4: Focus

The final and most "nefarious" problem:

> "The fourth problem that every business owner has to conquer is focus. And what is so nefarious about focus — it's so sneaky — because we are rewarded as entrepreneurs for taking a leap of faith, for taking a jump when there's nothing there, and then something starts to work."

The trap:

> "That's such a rewarding experience. You go from complete control to complete freedom. In that moment you're like 'this was the best decision of my entire life.' And the problem is that you should never do it again."

Why? Because you've trained yourself that switching = success:

> "When this gets hard — like my job was — you then think 'oh I'll do the same thing I did last time. I'll switch. I'll try something new.' And then that'll be exciting and new, just like a your relationship. And then all of a sudden you get out of the honeymoon..."

**The paradox:** The skill that got you started (taking leaps) will destroy you if you keep using it.

## The Hard Conversations

Solving these problems requires uncomfortable discussions. When you need to restructure compensation (Problem 2) or let go of bad customers (Problem 1), Hormozi's approach:

> "I just tell the truth. 'I messed up. I said that I was going to help you guys grow with this business. I said we were going to do these big things. But based on the decisions that I made because I'm a numbnuts, I mispriced your compensation. And because of that I'll never be able to give you career growth.'"

Some people will leave. That's part of the process:

> "And guess what skill you get to develop now? The ability to recruit talent with your new compensation structure, with your new vision of what's going to happen in their lives."

- **Problem 3 (Over-expansion):** Don't scale problems. Perfect the unit first.
