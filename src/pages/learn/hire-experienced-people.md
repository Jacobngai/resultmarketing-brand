excerpt: "Why hiring cheap, ambitious juniors often backfires — and when to pay 3x more for experienced hires."
malaysiaInsight: |
  In Malaysia, there's a strong culture of "giving chances" to fresh grads and young talent. Many SME owners hire juniors because they're cheaper and seen as more "moldable."

  But here's the reality I've seen with Malaysian SMEs:
  
  1. **Training costs are hidden** — You spend 6 months teaching them basics, then they leave for a multinational paying 30% more.
  
  2. **The real talent shortage** — Malaysia's best talent often goes to Singapore or remote roles. The ones who stay and have experience? Worth every ringgit.
  
  3. **The "cheap hire" trap** — A RM4,000/month junior who delivers 50% versus a RM10,000/month senior who delivers 300%? The math is obvious.
  
  My advice for Malaysian SME owners: For your first 3 hires, go experienced. Pay the premium. Once you have a strong foundation, THEN you can afford to train juniors — because your experienced team will do the training for you.

## The Confession

Sam Parr, co-founder of The Hustle (sold for $27M), shared something most entrepreneurs won't admit:

> "I tend to hire ambitious young people and take chances on them. And I hate to say it, but the majority of the time that is a horrible plan."

He's been making this mistake for years. The romantic idea of finding "diamonds in the rough" — young, hungry talent you can mold into superstars.

**The reality?** Hiring experienced people who cost 2-3x more delivers results that are 5-10x better.

## Why We Fall For This Trap

There are two reasons entrepreneurs keep hiring cheap juniors:

### 1. The American Dream Fantasy
We love the story of taking a broken person and fixing them. Finding someone nobody believed in and turning them into a star.

But that's ego, not strategy. You want to feel clever for "discovering" someone.

### 2. Frugality Addiction
Sam admits he built his companies with a "cheap" mindset — free desks off Craigslist, the dog as security. That mindset helped in the early days but becomes a liability when you need to execute.

## The Simple Question That Changed Everything

Before hiring a young, unproven candidate, ask:

> "We want this to go well. Does it make sense to go with somebody who has never done anything like this? Or are there people who have done similar things we could talk to first?"

That's it. A sanity check that forces you to consider the proven path.

## When Juniors CAN Work

![Mentorship and training in action](/images/mentorship-training.png)

Sam found one pattern that works: **Pair juniors with agencies.**

1. Hire an agency or consultant for 2 months
2. Month 1: They do the work
3. Month 2: They teach your junior how to do it

Now your ambitious young hire has a blueprint to follow, not a blank canvas to fill.

## The Core Lesson

**Hire for results, not for the story.**

Your job isn't to be a talent scout discovering hidden gems. Your job is to build a business that wins.

> "I always find people who say 'hire high agency people' or 'hire people whose growth rate is really high.' But in general, it's just kind of better to say: 'Hey, you already did this at this other company. Do it here, please.'"
