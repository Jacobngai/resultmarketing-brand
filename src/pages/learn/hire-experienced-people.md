excerpt: "Why hiring cheap, ambitious juniors often backfires — and when to pay 3x more for experienced hires."
malaysiaInsight: |
  In Malaysia, there's a strong culture of "giving chances" to fresh grads and young talent. Many SME owners hire juniors because they're cheaper and seen as more "moldable."

  But here's the reality I've seen with Malaysian SMEs:
  
  1. **Training costs are hidden** — You spend 6 months teaching them basics, then they leave for a multinational paying 30% more.
  
  2. **The real talent shortage** — Malaysia's best talent often goes to Singapore or remote roles. The ones who stay and have experience? Worth every ringgit.
  
  3. **The "cheap hire" trap** — A RM4,000/month junior who delivers 50% versus a RM10,000/month senior who delivers 300%? The math is obvious.
  
  My advice for Malaysian SME owners: For your first 3 hires, go experienced. Pay the premium. Once you have a strong foundation, THEN you can afford to train juniors — because your experienced team will do the training for you.

## The Confession

Sam Parr, co-founder of The Hustle (sold for $27M), shares the biggest mistake he keeps making:

> "I tend to hire ambitious young people and take chances on them. And I hate to say it, but the majority of the time that is a horrible plan."

He's been doing this for years. And he finally admits:

> "It's significantly better to hire more experienced people and pay them a lot more money — and I get way better results."

**The math is simple:**

> "They cost like two or three times more than a young and upcoming person, but the results are like five or 10 times better."

## Why We Fall For This Trap

Sam identifies two biases that lead entrepreneurs astray:

### 1. The Cheap Frugality Mindset

> "I like to be cheap as hell when I build my companies. Get the cheap office, get the free desk off Craigslist. Our dog will be security. I'm going to build this the frugal way."

This mindset helps in the early days — but becomes a liability when you need to execute. Frugality on desks is fine. Frugality on talent is expensive.

### 2. The "Diamond in the Rough" Fantasy

Sam admits the real reason he loves hiring juniors:

> "I fall in love with the sort of angel investing in people idea. It's like the raw up-and-comer, never done anything, found this diamond in the rough."

But here's the uncomfortable truth about why:

> "Why do I like that? It's not for generous reasons — it's because I feel cool that I found that thing, right? It's like finding a needle in a haystack."

The ego of "discovering" talent is seductive. But it's about YOU feeling clever — not about what's best for the business.

## The Simple Question That Changes Everything

Before hiring an unproven candidate, ask yourself:

> "We want this to go well, right? We want this to work. Does it make sense to just go with somebody who has never done anything even remotely like this? Or are there people in the world who have done very similar things that we could go talk to first?"

As soon as Sam started asking that question:

> "I definitely had that same mistake sometimes. It can work. And when it does work, it's the best story. But check this out — I have such a low hit rate with that, right? By definition, you're going to have a low hit rate with that strategy."

The experienced path is boring. But boring is profitable.

## The Agency + Junior Hybrid Strategy

Sam found one pattern that works — pairing inexperienced hires with external expertise:

> "I love hiring consultants and agencies, but I'll say: 'I'm only going to hire you for 2 months, and you're going to do the work for the first 30 days, but then the second 30 days, it's just you teaching me what to do.'"

The result:

> "I have found experience of like getting a young, ambitious, high agency, green person and teaming them up with an agency. And I have had some results with that."

This way, the junior gets a blueprint to follow, not a blank canvas to fill.

## Know Your Biases

The co-host sums it up:

> "Most of business is just figuring out what are your own leaks in your bucket. And then of course to other people who don't have that leak, they're like 'what? I mean obvious, right?' But you have to know what are my biases."

Sam's biases:
1. Being cheap
2. Wanting to find "lovable underdog" talent he can fix

> "It's not to say you never hire a junior person, but too often defaulting to that. And so you got to know your own biases."

## Key Takeaways

- **Experienced hires cost 2-3x more but deliver 5-10x results**
- **The "diamond in the rough" fantasy serves your ego, not your business** — "I feel cool that I found that thing"
- **Ask the sanity check question:** "Does it make sense to go with someone who has never done this?"
- **If you must hire juniors, pair them with agencies** who can train them
- **Know your biases** — frugality and "finding undiscovered talent" can hurt you
- **Boring is profitable** — hiring someone who's already done the job isn't exciting, but it works
