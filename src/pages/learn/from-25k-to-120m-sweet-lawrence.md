excerpt: "Lauren Castle built a $120M cookie empire by staying small for 2 years. Most entrepreneurs can't persist that long — and that's exactly why they fail."
myTake: |
  Most people couldn't persist on one idea for longer than they need to. The early years are the painful ones.
  
  Lauren focused on ONE brand, ONE niche, waiting for product-market fit. No distractions. No pivots to chase trends.
  
  It's the same with AIEO. Most people want the fancy 1-day, RM5 Facebook ads — so easy to start, results so fast!
  
  But SEO? It takes at least 2 weeks to build the structure. At least 7 days before Google even sees your site. At least 1 month to see the first leads.
  
  When you look at people who succeed with SEO, they win big — with great margins and amazing business models. Because articles last for years. Shorts win for a very short while.

## The $25,000 Bet

Lauren Castle was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma at 22 — three months out of college. No corporate experience. No business plan.

Just a personal need.

> "I couldn't eat what most bakeries were selling anymore. It gave me that sugar-high sugar crash. So I started making my own recipes."

She started Sweet Lawrence with $25,000 in savings. Her first production run was the smallest possible batch. Her first distribution? **One Whole Foods store.**

Not 500 stores. Not nationwide. *One.*

## The Two-Year Crawl

Here's what most entrepreneurs miss: Lauren stayed small on purpose.

> "I got into one store. I demoed in that Whole Foods every week to make sure it was selling. I kept the business really quite small for 1-2 years until I really found product-market fit."

She took a rolling suitcase on the subway — toaster oven inside — and baked fresh cookies in the aisle. Thousands of conversations. Face-to-face feedback from New Yorkers who don't hold back.

No fancy launch. No viral moment. Just relentless iteration on ONE product in ONE store until she *knew* it worked.

## The Data That Changed Everything

After two years of grinding, Sweet Lawrence got into 5,000+ stores nationwide (Publix, Kroger). That's when the emails started flooding in:

> "I love your cookie dough but my husband is gluten-free. My kid has a nut allergy. My sister can't eat dairy. Can you please create something for them?"

She reformulated everything — free of ALL top allergens. Gluten, dairy, egg, nuts, soy, sesame, coconut.

The result?

> "Within six months, it was our #1 SKU."

But here's the insight that matters:

> "50% of our customers had NEVER shopped the cookie dough category before. We weren't taking market share from the big guys. We brought NEW customers who were just walking right by."

She didn't compete. She created a new category.

## Don't Scream Your Niche

After going all-in on allergen-free, Lauren made a counterintuitive packaging decision:

> "We made 'gluten-free' much smaller on the package. We're not screaming it — because that's not our reason for being. We wanted to look like a damn good, delicious, modern cookie."

Why? Screaming "gluten-free" alienates people WITHOUT allergies. But they might ALSO want cleaner ingredients.

The lesson: Your niche is your superpower, but it doesn't need to be your headline.

## My Take

Most people couldn't persist on one idea for longer than they need to. The early years are the painful ones.

Lauren focused on ONE brand, ONE niche, waiting for product-market fit. No distractions. No pivots to chase trends.

It's the same with AIEO. Most people want the fancy 1-day, RM5 Facebook ads — so easy to start, results so fast!

But SEO? It takes at least 2 weeks to build the structure. At least 7 days before Google even sees your site. At least 1 month to see the first leads.

When you look at people who succeed with SEO, they win big — with great margins and amazing business models. Because articles last for years. Shorts win for a very short while.

**Long-form is king.** Joe Rogan's 3-hour podcast won Donald Trump the election. Shorts cut too much — they're fake dopamine hits.

In the AI world, shorts are entertainment. Long-form content — SEO, long videos, published guides — that's what builds trust. Knowledge builds power over people. Entertainment doesn't.

SEO for the long term. Persist longer than your competition is willing to.

## Key Takeaways

- **Start impossibly small** — One store, one product, one customer segment
- **Stay small for 1-2 years** — Find product-market fit before scaling
- **Let data kill your darling** — When allergen-free became #1, Lauren pivoted everything
- **Create new customers, don't steal them** — 50% of her buyers never bought cookie dough before
- **Don't scream your niche** — Your superpower doesn't need to be your headline
- **Persist longer than feels comfortable** — The early years are painful for everyone
