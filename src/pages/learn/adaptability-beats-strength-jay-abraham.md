excerpt: "Don't compete where you're disadvantaged. Find your adaptation advantage — like Bezos did against Barnes & Noble."
myTake: |
  I've read hundreds of entrepreneur books, and they all have one thing in common: entrepreneurs don't start as the strongest or the smartest. They're the most adaptable survival machines.
  
  Jeff Bezos started Amazon when Barnes & Noble was 10x his size. A Harvard MBA student told him to sell and get out. Bezos replied: "You might be underestimating the degree to which established companies will find it hard to be nimble."
  
  Today? Amazon is worth $2 trillion. Barnes & Noble sold for $683 million.
  
  Darwin said it best: it's not the strongest that survives, but the one that adapts best to change.
  
  Most people complain about what's changed. But change is nature. The question is: what advantage do you have from your disadvantage?

## The Lawyer Who Couldn't Play Golf

Jay Abraham tells the story of a female lawyer struggling to get corporate clients. The male lawyers in her market built relationships through golf and drinks — she couldn't compete in that arena.

Most people would tell her to try harder. Learn golf. Force herself into uncomfortable networking situations.

Jay's advice was different:

> "Don't compete where you're disadvantaged. Find a different angle."

Instead of trying to beat the male lawyers at their own game, she repositioned entirely. She became "THE attorney for women entrepreneurs."

She partnered with women's business associations, offered to be their legal advisor for free, and created webinars answering legal questions for their members.

The result?

> "If you help 10 organizations recommend you exclusively, you'll have more clients than you can handle."

She stopped competing on golf. She started competing on being the **only recommended choice**.

## My Take: The Bezos Lesson

I've read hundreds of entrepreneur books, and they all have one thing in common: entrepreneurs don't start as the strongest or the smartest. **They're the most adaptable survival machines.**

When Jeff Bezos started Amazon in 1994, Barnes & Noble was 10x his size. They had the stores, the brand, the inventory, the relationships. Amazon had... a garage.

A Harvard Business School student told Bezos:

> "You seem like a really nice guy, so don't take this the wrong way, but you really need to sell to Barnes and Noble and get out now."

Bezos replied:

> "You may be right. But I think you might be underestimating the degree to which established brick-and-mortar business, or any company that might be used to doing things a certain way, will find it hard to be nimble or to focus attention on a new channel. I guess we'll see."

Today? **Amazon is worth $2 trillion.** Barnes & Noble sold for $683 million in 2019 — they couldn't survive alone.

The Harvard MBA saw size. Bezos saw adaptability.

## Darwin Was Right

In *The Origin of Species*, Darwin wrote:

> "It is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself."

Most people complain about what's changed. But change is nature. **The question isn't whether things will change — it's whether you'll adapt faster than your competition.**

## The Modern Adaptation: AI-Readable Content

Here's where this gets practical for Malaysian businesses.

Most marketing agencies are focusing on video. TikTok, YouTube, Instagram Reels. It feels "modern."

But here's what they're missing: **AI cannot read video.**

- YouTube: AI can't scrape without permission
- TikTok: Completely walled garden
- Instagram: Zero API access for content
- Facebook: Locked down

These platforms are not giving AI permission to download and transcribe everything.

**But your website?**
- Perplexity scrapes it ✓
- ChatGPT browses it ✓
- Claude reads it ✓
- Google still indexes it ✓

Video creators are building assets that AI *cannot access*. Website owners are building assets that AI *must access* to answer questions.

The pitch writes itself:

> "Your competitors are making TikToks that AI will never see. We're making content that AI recommends when your customer asks a question."

That's not just SEO. That's **AIEO** — AI Engine Optimization. And it's the adaptation advantage hiding in plain sight.

## The Pattern

Jay Abraham's lawyer couldn't win at golf. She won by becoming the recommended expert for a specific community.

Bezos couldn't win by being bigger than Barnes & Noble. He won by being nimble enough to ride the internet wave.

You can't win by being a bigger agency or making more videos than your competition. **You win by positioning yourself where the future is going.**

The irony: video feels "modern" but it's building on platforms that are *closing* to AI. Text content feels "old school" but it's the only format AI can truly consume at scale.

## Key Takeaways

- **Don't compete where you're disadvantaged** — find a different angle
- **Adaptation beats strength** — Bezos vs Barnes & Noble proves it
- **Change is nature** — complaining about it is wasted energy
- **AI can't read video** — but it can read your website
- **Position for the future** — not where everyone is today

The question isn't whether you're the strongest. It's whether you're the most adaptable.

Stay nimble. Keep building. 🦎
