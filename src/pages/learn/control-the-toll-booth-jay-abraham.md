  This hit me hard. Most Malaysian SMEs compete on "better service" or "lower price" — the same game everyone plays.
  
  I've seen it over and over: agencies competing for the same clients, offering the same services, racing to the bottom on price.
  
  The toll booth principle changed how I think about business. Don't compete where everyone competes. Find the position where you're the ONLY option.

## The $400 Million Question

Jay Abraham charges $25,000 per person for a 90-minute consultation. In one session, he explained why most entrepreneurs work incredibly hard but never build real wealth.

The problem? They're selling products anyone else can sell.

> "If you're going to go to all of the trouble and all of the effort of setting up partnerships... it's probably better for you to search all of either Tokyo or the world and identify products that you can control yourself that are not being sold by everybody else."

This is the toll booth principle. And it separates business owners who build assets from those who just have jobs.

## The Commodity Trap

![The Commodity Trap - Competing With Everyone](/images/commodity-trap.png)

Jay was consulting with a Japanese woman who sold cosmetics through a network marketing company. She worked hard. She had ambition. But she had a fundamental problem:

> "You're taking a product that everybody else can sell and you don't have good profit margins so you have to work really hard to make any money."

She was competing with 10,000 other distributors in Japan selling the exact same products. Every time she convinced a medical clinic to sell her products, she was actually helping ALL distributors — because customers could buy from anyone.

### Why This Trap Is So Dangerous

1. **Low margins** — Multiple distribution layers mean you're fighting for scraps (10-30%)
2. **No competitive advantage** — Your marketing benefits competitors equally
3. **No sellable asset** — You're building THEIR business, not yours

> "You don't want to be one of 20,000 distributors in Japan selling that because every time you get a medical clinic to sell for you what they're really doing is selling for everybody because they're advertising your product but everybody else can sell it."

## The Toll Booth Position

![Distribution Ownership](/images/distribution-ownership.png)

Jay's alternative was simple but profound: **Control the product.**

> "If you can find great products — great beauty products that either exist in Japan or exist anywhere else in the world that can be easily and legally sold in Japan — then you could get the exclusive rights to them."

This is the toll booth. When you have exclusive rights, every sale must go through you. Every partner relationship you build benefits only YOU.

### The Panasonic Example

Jay reminded her of how Panasonic — now a $70+ billion company — started:

> "Remember I was talking about Panasonic yesterday... when they started they didn't have any products. They went to Phillips electronics in Germany and they secured the rights to their electronic products — their TVs, their radios, their toasters — to make them exclusively under the Panasonic or the Matsushita label in Japan."

Panasonic didn't invent anything. They controlled distribution. They owned the toll booth.

### The $400 Million Exit

And here's what happens when you build distribution you own:

> "A company... built a distribution channel to hair salons on the western part of the United States and they got the exclusive rights to a line of organic hair products and they were able to establish 1,000 hair salons... they did about $5 million in sales and they made about $400,000 in profit but a very large company Revlon wanted their distribution so they bought the company for $10 million."

But it gets better. Jay mentioned an even bigger example:

> "If you have the rights to a product — the exclusive rights — that's an asset. If you build distribution, if you build a hundred or five hundred partners that keep buying and rebuying and rebuying, that's a business that you have created... his company was sold for four hundred million dollars."

## How to Find Your Toll Booth

Jay's framework for escaping the commodity trap:

### Step 1: Search for Great Products with Bad Marketing

> "What I always do is I try to find great products with bad marketing and I try to tie up the rights to those products for my company."

Look for:
- Quality products with zero marketing presence in your market
- Companies focused on R&D but weak on distribution
- Foreign products not yet available in your region

### Step 2: Secure Exclusive Rights

The reason companies will give you exclusive rights? You bring distribution they don't have.

> "The reason that people would give you the exclusive rights are because you would control a distribution channel."

You're not asking for charity. You're offering access to 100+ partners they can't reach.

### Step 3: Build Distribution THEN Scale Products

Once you have distribution — medical clinics, salons, retailers, associations — you can add more products:

> "Now you have distribution that you can also gain control of a lot of other products that you can put through that distribution."

One distribution channel. Many products. That's leverage.

## My Take

This hit me hard. Most Malaysian SMEs compete on "better service" or "lower price" — the same game everyone plays.

I've seen it over and over: agencies competing for the same clients, offering the same services, racing to the bottom on price. Everyone works hard. Nobody builds a toll booth.

**What does a toll booth look like for local businesses?**

- Don't be another "digital marketing agency." Secure exclusive partnership with a specific software vendor for Southeast Asia.
- Don't be another "financial advisor." Become THE recommended advisor for a professional association.
- Don't be another "supplier." Get exclusive distribution rights for quality products not yet in Malaysia.

The work isn't easier. But the outcome is different: you're building an asset someone will buy, not just a job someone could replace.

## Key Takeaways

- **Stop selling commodities** — If 10,000 others can sell it, your hard work benefits everyone
- **Control the product** — Exclusive rights = you own the toll booth
- **Build distribution first** — Partners who buy repeatedly are your exit strategy
- **Think Panasonic** — They started with zero products and $70B later
- **$400M lesson** — Distribution you own is the only real business asset

> "If you are going to work hard and build distribution... you don't want them to sell a product that a thousand other distributors can sell. You want them to sell a product that you only are the one that has the rights to."

## This Is Why We Created Result Marketing

大巧若拙 — *"Great skill appears clumsy."*

Most marketing agencies fight for the same clients, offer the same services, compete on the same platforms. They look busy. They look impressive. But they're racing to the bottom.

We took a different approach: **AIEO** — AI Engine Optimization.

While others burn money on TikTok ads that AI will never see, we build content that AI actually recommends. Your website is the only asset ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude can read. That's our toll booth.

It doesn't look flashy. It just works.
